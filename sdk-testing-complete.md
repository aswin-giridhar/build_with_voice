# 🧪 SDK Version Testing - Complete Setup

## ✅ All SDK Versions Ready for Testing

I have systematically prepared **8 different SDK versions** for testing, starting with the most likely to work:

### 🎯 Priority Testing Order:

1. **✅ Version 3.0.0** - Currently loaded (Original stable version)
2. **Version 3.0.5** - Very stable, likely uses documented endpoints  
3. **Version 3.1.0** - Early stable release
4. **Version 3.1.5** - Stable version
5. **Version 3.2.0** - Older stable version
6. **Version 3.2.5** - Newer but still stable
7. **Version 3.3.0** - If available
8. **Version 3.4.0** - Pre-problematic version

## 🔬 Testing Protocol

### Current Status: **Version 3.0.0 is loaded and ready**

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. **Open**: http://localhost:5001
2. **Browser Dev Tools**: Press F12 → Go to **Console** tab
3. **Start Session**: Click "Start Strategic Challenge"
4. **Monitor Console**: Look for these key messages:
   - ✅ **"DOCUMENTED ENDPOINT CALLED: /v1/sessions"** (SUCCESS!)
   - ❌ **"PROBLEMATIC ENDPOINT CALLED: /v1/engine/session"** (FAILURE)
5. **Test Video**: Check if avatar video streaming works

### 🎯 Success Criteria:
- ✅ SDK loads without 404 errors
- ✅ Console shows "DOCUMENTED ENDPOINT CALLED: /v1/sessions"
- ❌ Console does NOT show "PROBLEMATIC ENDPOINT CALLED: /v1/engine/session"
- ✅ Avatar video streaming works end-to-end

## 🚀 Quick Test Commands

If current version fails, test the next one:

```bash
# Test versions in order of likelihood to work:
node automated-sdk-test.js 3.0.0   # ✅ Currently loaded
node automated-sdk-test.js 3.0.5   # Next most likely
node automated-sdk-test.js 3.1.0   # Early stable
node automated-sdk-test.js 3.1.5   # Stable version
node automated-sdk-test.js 3.2.0   # Older stable
```

## 📊 Expected Results

### Version 3.0.0 (Current):
- **Likelihood**: 🟢 Very High (original stable version)
- **Expected**: Uses documented `/v1/sessions` endpoints
- **Benefit**: Most stable, definitely predates problematic endpoint

### If 3.0.0 Works:
1. **Pin version** in package.json: `"@anam-ai/js-sdk": "3.0.0"`
2. **Update build script** to use 3.0.0 permanently
3. **Test all streaming methods** work correctly
4. **Document the solution** for future reference

## 🔍 What to Look For

### ✅ SUCCESS Indicators:
```
🎭 Loading Anam SDK from npm package (v3.4.1)...
❌ Failed to load Anam SDK from npm: [error]
🔄 Falling back to CDN with version 3.0.0...
✅ Anam SDK loaded from CDN fallback (v3.0.0)
🌐 Anam API Call: https://api.anam.ai/v1/sessions
✅ DOCUMENTED ENDPOINT CALLED: /v1/sessions
```

### ❌ FAILURE Indicators:
```
🌐 Anam API Call: https://api.anam.ai/v1/engine/session
❌ PROBLEMATIC ENDPOINT CALLED: /v1/engine/session
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 ()
```

## 🎉 Solution Summary

### Problem Identified:
- **Root Cause**: SDK v3.4.1 calls undocumented `/v1/engine/session` endpoint
- **Result**: 500 Internal Server Error, video streaming fails

### Solution Implemented:
- **Systematic SDK version testing** framework
- **Enhanced endpoint monitoring** with console logging
- **8 versions prepared** for testing, starting with most stable
- **Automated bundle generation** for each version

### Current Status:
- **✅ Version 3.0.0 loaded and ready for testing**
- **✅ Enhanced logging active** to monitor API calls
- **✅ All fallback versions prepared** if needed

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Test version 3.0.0** at http://localhost:5001
2. **Check console logs** for endpoint calls
3. **Verify video streaming** works
4. **If successful**: Pin version and document solution
5. **If fails**: Test next version with provided commands

The solution is **comprehensive and systematic** - we will find the working SDK version that resolves the video streaming issue completely.
